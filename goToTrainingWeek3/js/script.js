//how many fruits are in the bowl?
//how many items are in an array?
//length of the array
//Dot Syntax - "usa a period!"

//What is the last index number of the array, using the length property?
//Last index number is ALWAYS one less than the length
//bowlOfFruit.length - 1  is the last index number
